# 7DTD-FriendlyRekt

This is a very simple modlet that changes Trader Rekt's stance from Dislike to Like.  The result is that Rekt uses friendly dialog instead of being an asshole, nothing else about Trader Rekt is changed.

This modlet works on existing saves, no need to start new.  It can be run server-side without clients needing to download separately.

You can change the stance from "Like" to "Neutral" if you'd rather not have him be friendly.  Trader Hugh is neutral, for reference.
